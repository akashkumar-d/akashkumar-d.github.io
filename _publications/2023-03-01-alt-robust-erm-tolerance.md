  Developing simple, sample-efficient learning algorithms for robust classification is a pressing
  challenge. Classical robust learning approaches often require exponential sample complexity and
  complicated improper rules. We study robust empirical risk minimization (RERM), where the learner
  outputs a hypothesis minimizing training error. RERM is known to fail to robustly learn VC classes,
  a bound we extend even to ‘nice’ settings such as bounded halfspaces. Motivated by this, we study a
  relaxed model of tolerant robust learning, in which the output classifier is compared to the best
  achievable error over slightly enlarged perturbation sets. Under geometric niceness conditions, we
  show that a natural tolerant variant of RERM suffices for γ-tolerant robust learning of VC classes
  over R^d, requiring only Õ(VC(H)·d·log(D/γ)/ε^2) samples for robustness regions of (maximum)
  diameter D.
