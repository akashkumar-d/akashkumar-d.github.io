abstract: |
  The success of deep networks is crucially attributed to their ability to capture latent features
  within a representation space. We investigate whether the underlying learned features of a model
  can be efficiently retrieved through feedback from an agent (e.g., a large language model) in the
  form of relative triplet comparisons. These features may represent various constructs, including
  dictionaries in LLMs or components of a covariance matrix for Mahalanobis distances. We analyze the
  feedback complexity associated with learning a feature matrix in sparse settings. Our results
  establish tight bounds when the agent is permitted to construct activations and demonstrate strong
  upper bounds in sparse scenarios when the agent’s feedback is limited to distributional information.
  We validate our theoretical findings through experiments on two applications: feature recovery from
  Recursive Feature Machine-trained models and dictionary extraction from sparse autoencoders trained
  on Large Language Models.
