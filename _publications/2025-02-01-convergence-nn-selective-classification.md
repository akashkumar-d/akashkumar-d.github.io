  An elementary approach to \emph{selective classification} (also known as \emph{classification with a reject option}) is the $(k,k')$-rule: given a query $x$, find its $k$ nearest neighbors in the training set and if at least $k'$ of them have the same label, then predict that label; otherwise, abstain. We study this method under minimal assumptions to understand its convergence properties and its tradeoffs between error and abstention rate.
