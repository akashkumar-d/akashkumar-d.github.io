  We study the sample complexity of teaching, termed as "teaching dimension" (TD)
  in the literature, for the learning-with-equivalence-queries (LwEQ) paradigm.
  More concretely, we consider a learner who asks equivalence queries (i.e., “is the
  queried hypothesis the target hypothesis?”), and a teacher responds either
  “yes” or “no” along with a counterexample to the queried hypothesis. This learning
  paradigm has been extensively studied when the learner receives worst-case or
  random counterexamples; in this paper, we consider the optimal teacher who picks
  best-case counterexamples to teach the target hypothesis within a hypothesis
  class. For this optimal teacher, we introduce LwEQ-TD, a notion of TD capturing the
  teaching complexity (i.e., the number of queries made) in this paradigm. We show
  that a significant reduction in queries can be achieved with best-case
  counterexamples, in contrast to worst-case or random counterexamples, for different
  hypothesis classes. Furthermore, we establish new connections of LwEQ-TD to the
  well-studied notions of TD in the learning-from-samples paradigm.
