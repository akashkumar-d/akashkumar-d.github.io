	We study the sample complexity of teaching—termed the teaching dimension (TD)—in the
	learning-with-equivalence-queries (LwEQ) paradigm. In this setting, a learner queries whether a
	proposed hypothesis matches the target; a teacher answers “yes” or supplies a counterexample. While
	prior work focuses on worst-case or random counterexamples, we consider an optimal teacher who
	provides best-case counterexamples. We introduce LwEQ-TD to capture teaching complexity (number of
	queries) under this paradigm and show that best-case counterexamples can significantly reduce the
	number of queries across various hypothesis classes. We also establish new connections between
	LwEQ-TD and classical notions of TD in learning-from-samples.
