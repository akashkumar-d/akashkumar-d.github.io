abstract: |
	Recent advances in machine learning have led to increased interest in reproducing kernel Banach
	spaces (RKBS) as a more general framework that extends beyond reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
	(RKHS). While representer theorems have been established for several regularized learning schemes
	in RKBS, optimization methods that broadly encompass these results remain limited. We address a
	learning problem on Banach spaces endowed with a reproducing kernel and propose an algorithm based
	on mirror descent (MDA). Our approach iterates in the dual space using the reproducing kernel. We
	analyze convergence under various assumptions and establish two types of results: (1) conditions
	under which a linear convergence rate is achievable, akin to optimization in the Euclidean setting,
	and (2) a standard convergence rate in a constrained setting. To instantiate the algorithm, we
	introduce a novel family of RKBSs with p-norm (p ≠ 2) characterized by an explicit dual map and
	kernel.
