  Population loss can remain nearly constant while a neural network learns a substantially
  more predictive representation. We establish this separation for two-layer ReLU and
  leaky-ReLU networks trained on Gaussian inputs by simultaneous fixed-step population
  gradient descent on all parameters. For structured additive teachers whose links are
  positive mixtures of Gaussian-damped cubics in H¹(γ), we give explicit conditions under
  which small IID Gaussian initialization yields a high-probability guarantee: at a
  checkpoint during a high-loss plateau, minimum alignment between the rank-r teacher
  subspace and the leading r-dimensional eigenspace of the predictor's average gradient
  outer product (AGOP) increases by at least 1/2, and the minimum refit MSE under
  unchanged coefficient budgets decreases by more than 0.399, both relative to
  initialization. The same trajectory subsequently attains a trained loss below every
  value in the plateau window. A complementary result treats unequal-weight cubic teachers
  and small additive Sobolev perturbations using projected-feature refits. For SwiGLU
  networks with an exactly fitted intercept, we prove leading-AGOP alignment during a loss
  plateau at fixed width and dimension as Gaussian initialization vanishes, for
  square-integrable teachers with nonzero Hermite content of degree one, two, or three. A
  rank-one cubic specialization also gives simultaneous unrestricted-refit gains at a
  prescribed width. An approximation lower bound further shows that certain interaction
  targets retain nonzero error when ridge neurons are restricted to shared orthogonal axes
  within the teacher subspace. Population-moment experiments with ReLU students across 21
  teachers and 50 initializations per teacher complement the analysis.
