abstract: |
	We investigate the problem of learning distance functions in a query-based framework where the
	learner poses triplet queries of the form “Is x_i closer to x_j or x_k?”. We provide formal
	guarantees on the query complexity required to learn smooth (but otherwise general) distance
	functions under two notions of approximation: ω-additive and (1+ω)-multiplicative. For the
	additive approximation, we propose a global method whose query complexity is quadratic in the size
	of a finite cover of the sample space. For the (stronger) multiplicative approximation, we
	introduce a method that combines global and local approaches, utilizing multiple Mahalanobis
	distance functions to capture local geometry, with query complexity that scales quadratically with
	both the cover size and the ambient dimension.
