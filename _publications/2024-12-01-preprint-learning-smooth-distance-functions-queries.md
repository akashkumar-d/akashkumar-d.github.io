  In this work, we investigate the problem of learning distance functions within
  the query-based learning framework, where a learner is able to pose triplet
  queries of the form: “Is $x_i$ closer to $x_j$ or $x_k$?” We establish formal
  guarantees on the query complexity required to learn smooth, but otherwise general,
  distance functions under two notions of approximation: $\omega$-additive
  approximation and $(1 + \omega)$-multiplicative approximation. For the additive
  approximation, we propose a global method whose query complexity is quadratic in the
  size of a finite cover of the sample space. For the (stronger) multiplicative
  approximation, we introduce a method that combines global and local approaches,
  utilizing multiple Mahalanobis distance functions to capture local geometry. This
  method has a query complexity that scales quadratically with both the size of the
  cover and the ambient space dimension of the sample space.
